# Quick build
double-click build.bat

# Manual build
python build_exe.py
```

This creates:
- **Single .exe file** - Easy deployment to any Windows computer
- **No Python required** - Runs independently on shop computers
- **Professional installation** - Can install to Program Files
- **Portable version** - Run from USB drives or any folder
